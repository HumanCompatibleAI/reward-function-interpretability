# This commit on the branch final-obs of my (PavelCz) fork of procgen includes
# changes that add the final observation of an episode to the info dict. This
# final episode is useful when training reward functions and is not available by
# default in gym3, since gym3 immediately resets the environment after the
# episode ends.
