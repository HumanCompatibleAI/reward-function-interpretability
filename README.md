# Reward preprocessing
## Installation
First clone this repository.
We use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage dependencies.
If you haven't installed it yet, you can use for example
```
pip install --user pipenv
```
You will also need Mujoco. `mujoco_py` is installed as part of our
environment (see below) but its
[installation and troubleshooting instructions](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)
might still be helpful.
Once Mujoco is installed and has a license key,
you can reproduce the exact environment we use with
```
ci/setup.sh
```
(run this command inside the cloned repo). This will automatically create a new
virtual environment.
Use `pipenv shell` to start a shell inside this virtual environment.

## Docker
You can also use our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ejenner/reward_preprocessing)
instead of the installation procedure described above. However, note that the
Mujoco key file in `/root/.mujoco/mjkey.txt` is empty in the image, you will need
to enter a valid license key there.

`ci/docker.sh` is a helper script to build the Docker image, test it, and then
push it to DockerHub. You will need to set the `MUJOCO_KEY_URL` environment variable
to a URL that returns a valid Mujoco key when accessed, e.g.
```
MUJOCO_KEY_URL="https://..." ci/docker.sh
```
(the URL isn't needed to build the Docker image, but it's needed to test whether
Mujoco was installed correctly in the image).

## Running experiments
You can train an agent using
```
pipenv run python src/reward_preprocessing/train_agent.py
```
Arguments are passed using Sacred, e.g.
```
pipenv run python src/reward_preprocessing/train_agent.py with steps=10000
```
to train for 10000 steps.

The trained agent model and a video recording of the agent are stored via Sacred.

## Directories
`runs/` and `results/` are both in `.gitignore` and are meant to be used to
store artifacts. `runs/` is used for the Sacred `FileObserver`, so it contains
information about every single run. In contrast, `results/` is meant for
generated artifacts that are meant to be used by subsequent runs, such as trained
models or datasets of transition-reward pairs. It will only contain the versions
of these artifacts that are needed (e.g. the best/latest model), whereas `runs/`
will contain all the artifacts generated by past runs.

## Tests
Run
```
pipenv run pytest
```
to run all available tests (or just run `pytest` if the environment is active).

## Code style and linting
`ci/code_checks.sh` contains checks for formatting and linting.
We recommend using it as a pre-commit hook:
```
ln -s ../../ci/code_checks.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

To automatically change the formatting (rather than just checking it), run
```
ci/format_code.sh
```
Alternatively, you may want to configure your editor to run `black` and `isort` when saving a file.

Run `pipenv run pytype` (or just `pytype` inside the `pipenv` shell) to type check
the code base. This may take a bit longer than linting, which is why it's not part
of the pre-commit hook. It's still checked during CI though.
